# Space Travelers' Hub



By building this app, I learned how to use React & Redux (and even connect them to an API). 
The project was divided into four (4) milestones. That in bold is what I'm working on:

- Milestone 1: Initialize project with components
- Milestone 2: Create and remove a book
- Milestone 3: Connect to API
- **Milestone 4: Style the app**


## Live Demo

This project is not deployed yet. It will be deployed later to **Github Pages** and **Netlify**.
