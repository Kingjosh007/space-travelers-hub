# Space Travelers' Hub (React/Redux Group Project)

## Introduction

### About the requirements

> This is the repo for the second group project in our Microverse journey. It is project created by [Kingjosh007](https://github.com/Kingjosh007) and [mwanawabangona](https://github.com/mwanawabangona).


We had to combine all the knowledge we gained in the React/Redux module in order to build this project in 3-4 days. We had to work with the real live data from the SpaceX API. Our task was to build a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The requirements we had to meet included: 

- Use React components, including conditional components;
- Use React Router;
- Connect React and Redux;
- Handle events in a React application;
- Use React life cycle methods;
- Apply React best practices and language style guides in code;
- Use store, actions and reducers in React;
- Perform a code review for a team member;
